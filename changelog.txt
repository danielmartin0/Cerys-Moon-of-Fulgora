---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.5.3
Date: 2025-07-03
  Bugfixes:
    - Krastorio 2: Fixed that the K2SO lithium recipe was unlocked by Fulgoran cryogenics rather than the vanilla lithium recipe as intended.
    - Krastorio 2: The plutonium magazine rounds from Cerys are replaced by plutonium rifle magazines and plutonium anti-materiel rifle magazines.
  Balancing:
    - Reverted buff to Overclock modules. Their productivity effect has been reverted from -4% to -5%.
    - Greatly increased the crafting time for plutonium magazine rounds since 10 magazines are crafted in one recipe.
  Graphics:
    - Reduced the visual size of solar wind.
    - The speed of wind on Cerys for visual effects is now 0.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.5.1-3.5.2
Date: 2025-06-30
  Changes:
    - Renamed 'Speed module 3 by Fulgoran cryogenics' to 'Speed module 3 from nitric acid' and changed the icon.
  Balancing:
    - Like the recipe 'Processing units from nitric acid', 'Speed module 3 from nitric acid' now requires fewer chips than the original recipe.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.5.0
Date: 2025-06-30
  Changes:
    - Drive module replaced by a recipe for Speed module 3. This is because the Overclock module as published ought to require Speed module 3 to craft. Moreover this is a conceptual simplification.
    - Overclock modules no longer require processing units to craft but now require Speed module 3 instead of Speed module 2.
    - Recycling Speed module 3 on Cerys no longer produces tungsten carbide.
    - Cryogenic plants can no longer be placed on Cerys.
  Balancing:
    - Reduced the energy consumption of the Fulgoran cryogenic plant (-16%).
    - Increased the crafting time of certain Fulgoran cryogenics recipes: Cerysian science pack (2s -> 6s), processing units from nitric acid (1.8s -> 2s), methane ice dissociation (5.5s -> 6s).
    - Increased the ammonia produced by nitrogen-rich mineral processing (+50%).
    - Buffed the Overclock module by reducing the productivity effect (-5% -> -4%).
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed missing English locale entry for Nitric acid.
    - Fixed that surface conditions of the fusion power cell recipe prevented it from being crafted in Fulgoran cryogenic plants.
    - Fixed a crash when Cupric Asteroids is installed but another mod has removed the cupric asteroid entities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.4.8
Date: 2025-06-29
  Bugfixes:

    - When using Hard Cerys, the Sulfuric acid needed for nitrogen-rich mineral processing is increased from 15 to 35.
  Compatibility:
    - The errors reporting a missing Lunaponics mod now fire when the Factorio client boots.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.4.0-3.4.6
Date: 2025-06-28
  Changes:
    - Due to Cerys' philosophy of avoiding disturbing vanilla, the level 4 productivity module (Yield module) has been removed due to its effect on the Space Age endgame.
    - Removed the unlock of Productivity module 3 on Cerys (and the associated special handling of recycling it).
    - Cerys now instead has two new modules with downsides: the Drive module (a Tier 2 prod module) and the Overclock module (a Tier 4 speed module). In the endgame, the Drive module generally becomes obsolete and the Overclock module plays a niche role.
  Balancing:
    - Increased the sulfuric acid in nitrogen-rich mineral processing back to 15 (from 10).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.3.7-3.3.8
Date: 2025-06-27
  Changes:
    - Added a setting to remove biter eggs from the vanilla Prod 3 module recycling recipe on all planets, not just Cerys.
    - Advanced circuits reinstated in the Prod 3 recipe to make quality Prod 3s harder to produce. (Note that quality modules cannot be used on this recipe.)
  Balancing:
    - Nerfed Yield module productivity from 18% to 16%.
    - Yield modules now increase pollution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.3.6
Date: 2025-06-27
  Changes:
    - Added a mod setting to disable the Yield module technology.
  Balancing:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.3.4
Date: 2025-06-27
  Changes:
    - Overclock module renamed to Yield module. This name fits better due to the reduced speed.
    - Yield module technology requiring Maraxsis science packs is now an option, disabled by default.
  Balancing:
    - The Cerys recipe for Productivity module 3, as with the Yield module recipe, no longer accepts quality modules.
  Graphics:
    - Graphical tweak to the Yield module.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.3.3
Date: 2025-06-27
  Compatibility:
    - With Maraxsis installed, the Overclock module technology now requires Hydraulic science packs to research.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-06-26
  Compatibility:
    - Krastorio 2: Adjusted Cerys for the fact that K2SO merged the Space Age and K2 lithium items two days ago.
  Balancing:
    - Overclock module buffed from 17% productivity to 18% productivity and speed debuff changed from -25% to -30%.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.3.1
Date: 2025-06-26
  Changes:
    - Adjusted the Fulgoran Cryoplant Prod 3 recipe to require green chips instead of red.
    - Productivity modules no longer recycle to biter eggs when recycled on Cerys (but still do outside to maintain vanilla compatibility).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.3.0
Date: 2025-06-26
  Features:
    - One more planet reward, likely the final to be added: The Overclock module, a type of Tier 4 productivity module with strong productivity at a drawback of inhibiting quality by -100% (along with significantly reduced speed). Quality modules cannot be used when crafting it.
    - An alternative recipe for Productivity module 3 is now available in the Fulgoran cryoplant.
  Changes:
    - Rearrangements to the tech tree.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.2.3
Date: 2025-06-26

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.2.0-3.2.2
Date: 2025-06-26
  Info:
    - This update brings deeper compatibility with Krastorio 2 (via the Spaced Out mod). It includes a few breaking changes to existing K2SO bases on Cerys, namely recipe changes to utility tech cards, nitric acid, and certain recycling recipes.
  Compatibility:
    - Krastorio 2: Merged the Cerys and K2 nitric acid fluids.
    - Krastorio 2: The Cerys recipe for Nitric acid is now performed in the Fulgoran cryogenic plant using ammonia and oxygen.
    - Krastorio 2: Utility tech cards now have a surface-specific tweaked recipe for Cerys. This means that reactor repair on Cerys is necessary.
    - Krastorio 2: The recipes for charging rods and the Fulgoran reactor scaffold now require steel beams instead of steel plates.
    - Krastorio 2: Rare metals are no longer provided in nuclear scrap recycling.
    - Krastorio 2: Cerys no longer enforces certain recycling recipes to match vanilla when K2 is installed, namely: electronic circuit, advanced circuit, processing unit, iron gear wheel, steam turbine.
    - Krastorio 2: The Cerys hydrogen bomb now requires hydrogen.
  Changes:
    - 'Fulgoran machine quality upgrades' technology folded into 'Advanced structure repair'.
    - Upgrading the quality of the Fulgoran reactor no longer requires a repair step — just super-force building a quality scaffold on a repaired reactor is enough.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that the Fulgoran teleporter could spawn out of range of the heating towers on new saves.
    - Fixed that higher-quality Fulgoran reactors could not be upgraded again.
  Balancing:
    - Reduced the science cost of two technologies: Mixed-oxide waste recycling (125 -> 50) and Plutonium weaponry (800 -> 750).
    - Partially reverted the reduction to the second-or-later cryogenic plant repair cost (120 -> 150).
    - Tweaked the recipe costs of the Fulgoran reactor scaffold.

  Balancing:
    - Adjusted the recipe for processing units from nitric acid to use the same amount of nitric acid as sulfuric acid used in the vanilla recipe.
  Bugfixes:
    - On new saves, fixed that space platform foundations could be placed around Cerys, which caused problems with asteroid gameplay and other areas. Since Factorio cannot handle migrating tiles that contain covering tiles which would now collide, old saves are migrated to have Cerys surrounded by the empty-space tile.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.21
Date: 2025-01-18

    - Quantitative adjustments to mixed-oxide fuel cell recycling recipes.
    - Solar wind particle size reduced slightly.
    - Mini-explosion average sound volume increased.
  Bugfixes:
    - Robot power usage is now 2x rather than 20x. (Gravity on Cerys has been reduced by a factor of 10 to achieve this.)
