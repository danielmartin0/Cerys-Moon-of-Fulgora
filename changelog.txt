    - Fixed that the module technology icons became blurry on certain graphics settings.
  Changes:
    - Spawned slightly more water on new Cerys maps.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.12.8
Date: 2025-10-13

    - Krastorio 2 Spaced Out: Flare stacks from the Flare Stack mod are now hidden in Factoriopedia as intended.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.12.5
Date: 2025-10-11
  Compatibility:
    - Krastorio 2 Spaced Out: Flare stacks from the Flare Stack mod are no longer researchable when K2SO is installed, as Krastorio 2 provides its own Flare stacks. (Existing entities will continue to function.)
    - Organized Solar System: Adjusted the angle of Cerys around Fulgora to collide less frequently with other routes.
  Graphics:
    - Minor graphical tweaks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.12.3
Date: 2025-10-05
  Compatibility:
    - Re-inserted the incompatibility marks removed in 4.12.2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.12.2
Date: 2025-10-05
  Compatibility:
    - Removed ALL incompatibility marks for this version, such that players upgrading into Factorio stable have a version of Cerys that accounts for the breaking change in Factorio 2.0.67 while guaranteeing to support their existing save.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.12.1
Date: 2025-10-05
  Changes:
    - Added new prerequisites to the optional 'Applications of radioactivity' technology: Uranium ammo, Portable fission reactor.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that with Krastorio 2 Spaced Out installed, Reverse-engineered research data was not unlockable.
  Compatibility:
    - Re-inserted incompatibility with Bob's Metals, Chemicals and Intermediates because the interaction between the recycling chains, resource provisions and Cerys gameplay has not been studied in a compatibility patch.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.12.0
Date: 2025-10-04
  Balancing:
    - Buffed the productivity bonus of Radioactive modules by two percentage points (and the decayed form by one percentage point).
    - Rebalancing tweaks to Mineral leaching: this recipe now requires more sulfuric acid (nerf) but produces extra iron ore (buff). The latter change helps indicate that this recipe is a good source of iron.
    - Further increased the mining time of nitrogen-rich minerals.
    - Slightly increased U235 from nuclear scrap recycling.
    - Throughput of methane ice dissociation recipe increased.

    - Krastorio 2 Spaced Out: (Breaking change) Nuclear scrap recycling now produces LDS. This supplements the copper needed for automation cores and reduces the demand for plastic which is very difficult to obtain.
    - Krastorio 2 Spaced Out: New icons and names for the science recipes on Cerys.
    - Krastorio 2 Spaced Out: The 'Prevent recycling recipe overrides' setting no longer reverts the heat pipe recycling recipe to vanilla when K2SO is installed.
    - Krastorio 2 Spaced Out: Cerysian ruins now drop extra iron gear wheels (+50%).
    - If Fulgora has been deleted, Cerys no longer tries to orbit another planet with lightning (this led to undesired behavior with the Shattered Planet mod).
    - Corrected the planet displayed behind Cerys in cases where another mod makes Cerys orbit a celestial body other than Fulgora.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.11.0-4.11.3
Date: 2025-09-24
  Info:
    - These releases add support for Factorio 2.0.67, handling a breaking change in the Factorio engine. Players upgrading their client to 2.0.67 or greater will need to update Cerys to v4.11.

    - Fixed that upgrading the quality of the Fulgoran reactor did not consume the player's scaffold from their cursor.
  Compatibility:
    - Marked certain Bob's Mods as incompatible for now since they cause the player to get softlocked on Cerys.
    - Marked Oarc Multiplayer Spawn as incompatible for now since the Fulgoran buildings on Cerys are associated to the 'player' force.
    - Marked Janus as incompatible for now as this mod currently interferes with water tiles on Cerys by destroying their unique collision mask.
    - Marked Automated Crushers as incompatible for now as this mod prevents Fulgoran crushers on Cerys from working.
  Locale:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.9.0-4.9.3
Date: 2025-09-03
  Changes:
    - Breaking change: Charged particle deflection reverted to Cerys v3 (2 weeks ago). We realized a fundamental problem with long-range deflection: it makes the particles behave less like 'pinballs' and they thermalize faster. Due to time-reversal symmetry, thermalized particles are impossible to accumulate in any zone. v4 worked for basic farms, but was impossible to optimize without making the farm the size of the moon. We have however kept a modest version of evaporation at low speeds in order to buff non-trapping designs in relative terms. This is intended as long-term stable and is non-breaking with v3 bases.
    - Breaking change (minor): Crafting radioactive modules now requires a radioactive isotope (U235) instead of chips.
    - Ghost charged particles now react to ghost charging rods.
    - The base of charging rods now always glows with the polarity color, making it easier to infer their polarity when uncharged or partially charged.
    - U235 can no longer be recycled prior to unlocking waste reprocessing (as with U238).
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that blueprints containing multiple charging rods did not paste their settings correctly. (Big thanks to thelordthygod for solving this meaty technical problem in their Blueprint Library mod.)
    - Fixed that ghost charging rods couldn't have a polarity set.
    - Fixed that ice platform and foundation tiles on Cerys collided with asteroids.
  Balancing:
    - Tweaked technology costs.
  Optimizations:
    - Charged particle optimizations.
  Compatibility:
    - Space Age Hard Mode: Kovarex is now unlocked by Moon Discovery Cerys and is no longer a prerequisite (since the Kovarex tech is locked behind Gleba+Fulgora).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.8.0-4.8.2
Date: 2025-09-01
  Changes:
    - Slight tweak to charged particles after discussions in Discord. They are now deflected at 1/r^2 (from 1/r^1.5 in v4.0, previously 1/r^2.5 in v3). Compared to v4, this slightly reduces the complexity of long-range interactions and makes close-range collisions less abrupt. Also, the voltage of charging rods now increases with quality.
    - Ghost charged particles now treat everything as fully charged.
    - Ghost charged particle makers create ghosts in a [-0.5, 0.5]x[-0.5, 0.5] area rather than just at the tip.
    - Water no longer spawns in the lithium brine area.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.7.0-4.7.13
Date: 2025-08-30

    - Breaking change (minor): Crafting hydrogen bombs now requires Pu238 and U235.
    - Neutrons now behave differently in vacuum (their open-air behavior is unchanged).
    - Crafting Neutron bombs no longer require processing units.
    - Charged particles now move slower (but in the same paths and gameplay is unchanged).
    - Radiation-proof inserters no longer switch states continuously if both the target and destination are valid targets.
    - Renamed 'Explosives from ammonium nitrate' to 'Explosives by nitrate oxidation'.
    - Improvements to map generation.
    - Dry ice can no longer be paved over without melting it.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that the U235 in nuclear scrap recycling was incorrect since 4.0.
    - Fixed that launching hydrogen bombs from Cerys to space platforms would trigger the atmospheric explosion visual effect.
    - Fixed that the new Cerys concrete tiles could not be selected by the deconstruction planner or pipette.
  Balancing:
    - Adjusted the Pu238 amounts in various recipes.
    - Tweaks to technology costs.
  Graphics:
    - Graphical improvements to tile transitions, methane ice, and particle ghosts.
  Sounds:
    - Soundtrack adjustments.
  Compatibility:
    - Fixed a crash when the following three mods were present at once: K2SO, BZ Tin, Wooden Cerys Lunaponics.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.6.0-4.6.4
Date: 2025-08-29
  Changes:
    - Crafting Overclock modules no longer requires superconductors.
    - Added hydrogen bombs to the Cerys cargo drops whitelist (in case players accidentally launch it to a platform rather than to orbit).
  Graphics:
    - Frozen concrete tiles now have custom graphics on Cerys.
    - Players in orbit around Cerys now see the flash from hydrogen nukes launched from the surface.
  Balancing:
    - Reduced the crafting time of Space science pack from methane ice (-50%), charging rods (-50%), and the reactor scaffold (-50%).
    - Tweaked the ingredient amounts for scaffolds, Cerysian labs, and crusher repair.
    - Increased the maximum power inflow of charging rods (+50%).
    - Reduced the energy consumption of the Fulgoran cryogenic plant (-8%).
  Sounds:
    - Removed a stray non-custom track that was still in the playlist.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug where the Fulgora background could become enlarged when toggling the 'Use Fulgora starmap graphic' setting on and off.
  Locale:
    - Added a new German translation. (Thanks Schlumpf!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.5.0-4.5.10
Date: 2025-08-27
  Changes:
    - Hydrogen bombs are no longer crafted from Atomic bombs. (Atomic bombs are removed from the Cerys tech tree.)
    - 'Explosives from ammonium nitrate' can now also be crafted in chemical plants.
    - 'Processing units from nitric acid' can now also be crafted in electromagnetic plants.
    - The destinations of the Fulgoran teleporter on Fulgora are now more remote.
    - Adjusted the terrain generation on new maps.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that the rocket weight of Plutonium-238 and Plutonium-239 was 5x higher than intended (it now matches that of uranium rocks.)
  Balancing:
    - Reduced the rate of cooling of heat pipes and boilers on Cerys (-50%). This makes it easier to build large heat pipe setups.
    - The reactor cooling rate now decreases with quality. These values are now shown in the entity tooltip.
    - Nuclear scrap recycling: increased pipes (1.7% -> 2%) and heat pipes (0.5% -> 0.8%).

  Changes:
    - Breaking change (minor): Crafting charging rods now requires copper cable instead of superconductors.
    - Reinstated the Overclock module by popular demand.
    - Renamed the Metastable module to the Radioactive module.
    - Reverted the v4.0.0 change that gave charging rods higher energy storage capacity. This is to reduce the awkwardness of setting up charging rods for testing.
    - Charged particles no longer have a 'cooldown': colliding with inventories no longer prevents colliding with other inventories for a short period of time, as long as the inventory is different.
    - The construction bot exemption from the cargo drop ban is now mentioned in the ingame planet description.
  Balancing:
    - Increased the mutation rate of Plutonium-239 by 12% and the spawn rate of charged particles by 4%. We will tune these numbers in future based on player feedback.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that the plutonium generation Tips & Tricks entry was unlocked by a side technology. It is now unlocked by researching Plutonium weaponry.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented plutonium from being generated.
  Sounds:
    - Dropped the remaining three non-custom tracks from the Cerys playlist, leaving only custom tracks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.3.0-4.3.2
Date: 2025-08-22
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that Radiation-proof inserters would not turn back on after being disabled by the 'X' circuit signal.
    - Fixed that Radiation-proof inserters did not interact properly with labs. (You need to replace existing lab inserters for this to work.)
  Compatibility:
    - Muluna: Adjusted the Cerys atmospheric oxygen surface condition to 1% to avoid burner inserters being banned.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.0-4.2.6
Date: 2025-08-20
  Changes:

    - Fixed that Radiation-proof inserters only worked with Normal-quality modules.
    - Fixed that ghost charged particles could sometimes act like real ones for REDACTED.
  Compatibility:
    - K2SO: 'Prevent recycling recipe overrides' now protects recycling recipes for chips and electronic components.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.1.0-4.1.7
Date: 2025-08-19
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that the hydrogen bomb was uncraftable (by providing a new nitrate recipe for explosives).
    - Fixed the description of the Radiation-proof inserter.
  Changes:
    - The vanilla rocket fuel recipe is no longer banned on Cerys.
    - Crafting radiative towers now requires Plutonium-238.
    - 'Plutonium weaponry' now unlocks the atomic bomb item.
    - Adjusted technology prerequisite relationships.
  Balancing:
    - Sulfuric acid required for mineral leaching increased from 15 to 20.
    - Space science pack from methane ice now produces 1 pack per craft (from 5). The cost of related technologies has been reduced to compensate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.0.0-4.0.6
Date: 2025-08-18
  Info:
    - 4.0 release. According to a long-time Cerys playtester, "In terms of grind, it is really a vast vast improvement." 4.0 also reworks the science tree, adds a Tier 4 prod module reward with a twist, adds a charged particle testing entity, and has the player blast a hole in the magnetosphere.
  Features:
    - New completion reward: Metastable module. This is a radioactive Tier 4 productivity module that decays to a Tier 2.5 equivalent, but can be recharged with Plutonium-239 in a centrifuge. The new Radiation-proof inserter is designed to insert it directly into machine module slots, and automatically flips itself when required.
    - A new entity assists with plutonium farm planning by allowing players to simulate their effectiveness.
  Changes:
    - The Cerys tech tree is now less linear, giving players greater choice over which research to pursue next.
    - Cerys technologies no longer require automation (red) or utility (yellow) science. Some instead require space science, which can now be crafted on Cerys using methane ice.
    - Cerysian science has been renamed 'Reverse-engineered science' and is simplified to require holmium plates instead of superconductors.
    - Charged particles now evaporate when they come to a stop.
    - Charged particle deflection now occurs over longer distances.
    - The cargo drops technology is now called 'Blast a hole in the magnetosphere' and requires the player to launch a hydrogen bomb into orbit.
    - The final radiative towers technology now allows the player to mine the Fulgoran radiative towers on Cerys.
    - Machine quality upgrades no longer require quality chips, instead simply requiring 5 repair parts.
    - Nitrogen-rich mineral processing has been renamed 'Mineral leaching' and is simplified to no longer require water.
    - The Overclock module has been removed from the Cerys tech tree as it wouldn't have been added if the Metastable module was in place. Already-crafted Overclock modules are retained.
  Balancing:
    - Repair costs of Fulgoran cryogenic plants reduced.
    - Charging rods store +50% energy, but appear less frequently in ruins.
    - The mixed-oxide fuel cell recipe no longer admits productivity modules. In order not to break existing space platforms, legacy saves that have completed Cerys unlock a secret technology granting the lost productivity bonus (Legendary T3 equivalent).
  Graphics:
    - New icons for repair recipes.
  Sounds:
    - Added a track to the custom soundtrack.
  Compatibility:
    - K2SO: The Gas power station now has a max ambient radiation condition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.8.3-3.8.4

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.8.1
Date: 2025-08-07
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that lithium brine could spawn over frozen water on Cerys and be destroyed when the ice melted.
  Compatibility:
    - K2SO: Moved various recipe updates to data-updates to allow data-final-fixes processing by third party mods. In particular, when Maraxsis is installed, the hydrogen bomb is now once again craftable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.8.0
Date: 2025-08-03
  Locale:
    - Updated the outdated French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Ukranian and Chinese translations to a full translation set.
  Bugfixes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.7.0
Date: 2025-07-27
  Changes:
    - The ambient rate of cooling of heat pipes on Cerys is now slower for each neighbouring heat pipe it is adjacent to. This change is balanced to leave the cooling rate of heat pipes with 2 neighbours unaffected.
  Balancing:
    - Buffed holmium plates obtained from nuclear scrap recycling to 1% (from 0.8%).
    - Reduced the energy consumption of the Fulgoran cryogenic plant by 10%.
    - Reduced the science cost of 'Applications of radioactivity' (100 -> 80).
  Compatibility:
    - Added an incompatibility mark with Resource Spawner Overhaul.
    - Compatibility with modded qualities: Capped the heating range of radiative towers to 30 to prevent a crash.
  Optimizations:
    - Significantly increased the performance of the cooling algorithm.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.6.10
Date: 2025-07-26
  Balancing:
    - Buffed holmium plates obtained from nuclear scrap recycling to 0.8% (from 0.6%).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.6.9
Date: 2025-07-25
  Sounds:
    - Switched the Cerys hero track (played on landing) to a less melancholic track.

  Balancing:
    - Like the recipe 'Processing units from nitric acid', 'Speed module 3 from nitric acid' now requires fewer chips than the original recipe.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.5.0
Date: 2025-06-30
  Changes:
    - Drive module replaced by a recipe for Speed module 3. This is because the Overclock module as published ought to require Speed module 3 to craft. Moreover this is a conceptual simplification.
    - Overclock modules no longer require processing units to craft but now require Speed module 3 instead of Speed module 2.
    - Recycling Speed module 3 on Cerys no longer produces tungsten carbide.
    - Cryogenic plants can no longer be placed on Cerys.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.4.0-3.4.6
Date: 2025-06-28
  Changes:
    - Due to Cerys' philosophy of avoiding disturbing vanilla, the level 4 productivity module (Yield module) has been removed due to its effect on the Space Age endgame.
    - Removed the unlock of Productivity module 3 on Cerys (and the associated special handling of recycling it).
    - Cerys now instead has two new modules with downsides: the Drive module (a Tier 2 prod module) and the Overclock module (a Tier 4 speed module). In the endgame, the Drive module generally becomes obsolete and the Overclock module plays a niche role.
  Balancing:
    - Increased the sulfuric acid in nitrogen-rich mineral processing back to 15 (from 10).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.3.7-3.3.8

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.3.4
Date: 2025-06-27
  Changes:
    - Overclock module renamed to Yield module. This name fits better due to the reduced speed.
    - Yield module technology requiring Maraxsis science packs is now an option, disabled by default.
  Balancing:

  Changes:
    - Adjusted the Fulgoran Cryoplant Prod 3 recipe to require green chips instead of red.
    - Productivity modules no longer recycle to biter eggs when recycled on Cerys (but still do outside to maintain vanilla compatibility).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.3.0
Date: 2025-06-26
  Features:
    - One more planet reward, likely the final to be added: The Overclock module, a type of Tier 4 productivity module with strong productivity at a drawback of inhibiting quality by -100% (along with significantly reduced speed). Quality modules cannot be used when crafting it.
    - An alternative recipe for Productivity module 3 is now available in the Fulgoran cryoplant.
  Changes:
    - Rearrangements to the tech tree.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 3.2.3
Date: 2025-06-26

    - This update brings deeper compatibility with Krastorio 2 (via the Spaced Out mod). It includes a few breaking changes to existing K2SO bases on Cerys, namely recipe changes to utility tech cards, nitric acid, and certain recycling recipes.
  Compatibility:
    - K2SO: Merged the Cerys and K2 nitric acid fluids.
    - K2SO: The Cerys recipe for Nitric acid is now performed in the Fulgoran cryogenic plant using ammonia and oxygen.
    - K2SO: Utility tech cards now have a surface-specific tweaked recipe for Cerys. This means that reactor repair on Cerys is necessary.
    - K2SO: The recipes for charging rods and the Fulgoran reactor scaffold now require steel beams instead of steel plates.
    - K2SO: Rare metals are no longer provided in nuclear scrap recycling.
    - K2SO: Cerys no longer enforces certain recycling recipes to match vanilla when K2 is installed, namely: electronic circuit, advanced circuit, processing unit, iron gear wheel, steam turbine.
    - K2SO: The Cerys hydrogen bomb now requires hydrogen.
  Changes:
    - 'Fulgoran machine quality upgrades' technology folded into 'Advanced structure repair'.
    - Upgrading the quality of the Fulgoran reactor no longer requires a repair step — just super-force building a quality scaffold on a repaired reactor is enough.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that the Fulgoran teleporter could spawn out of range of the heating towers on new saves.
    - Fixed that higher-quality Fulgoran reactors could not be upgraded again.
  Balancing:
    - Reduced the science cost of two technologies: Mixed-oxide waste recycling (125 -> 50) and Plutonium weaponry (800 -> 750).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.26
Date: 2025-01-18
  Bugfixes:
    - Reinstated the tile cerys-empty-space. Although this tile does not have the desired properties, migrating it to empty-space was problematic because some bases relied on voiding items by dropping onto empty space with an inserter. cerys-empty-space is left as a legacy tile, whilst new saves will use cerys-empty-space-2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.25
Date: 2025-01-18

    - Defrosting water puddles no longer destroy offshore pumps.
  Balancing:
    - Adjusted the recipe for processing units from nitric acid to use the same amount of nitric acid as sulfuric acid used in the vanilla recipe.
  Bugfixes:
    - On new saves, fixed that space platform foundations could be placed around Cerys, which caused problems with asteroid gameplay and other areas. Since Factorio cannot handle migrating tiles that contain covering tiles which would now collide, old saves are migrated to have Cerys surrounded by the empty-space tile.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.21
Date: 2025-01-18
  Changes:
    - Re-removed the limitation on requesting a maximum of 200 ice tiles to transition at once, since this will be unrelated to the reported bug. This fixes ice melting in an unusual order.
