Cerys-Moon-of-Fulgora=雪璃星

[mod-description]
Cerys-Moon-of-Fulgora=一颗神秘的卫星。被厚冰层掩盖的远古机器似乎可以被修复，其中还有一个恢弘的反应堆，有改变地貌的强大可能……前提是把它修好。\n\n雪璃星被设计成一个完整的星球模组，不影响原版游戏体验。你可以在原版游戏中无缝添加它。
;; Fulgora's moon of puzzles. Ancient wrecks embedded in thick ice can seemingly be repaired, including a colossal nuclear reactor that could transform the possibilities on the surface... if you can get it working.\n\nCerys is a polished and complete planet mod that does not affect the vanilla game in any way, so is easy to include in existing saves.
