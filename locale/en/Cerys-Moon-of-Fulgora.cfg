[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
cerys-briefing=[planet=cerys] is an airless moon orbiting Fulgora.\nSolar particles deflected by the magnetic field of [planet=fulgora] stream overhead and interfere with unmanned spacecraft until the research of [technology=planetslib-cerys-cargo-drops].\nThe surface is covered by multiple layers of [item=methane-ice] and is littered with ancient machine wrecks. Many of these can be revived, including [entity=cerys-fulgoran-radiative-tower] which radiates heat in a square zone.\nBesides methane ice, you can find [entity=cerys-nuclear-scrap], [entity=cerys-ruin-medium], [entity=cerys-nitrogen-rich-minerals] and [entity=lithium-brine].\nIt isn't possible to leave Cerys right after landing, so it is recommended to bring a snack.
cerys-plutonium-generation=[item=plutonium-239] has a chance to be created whenever [entity=cerys-solar-wind-particle] collides with [item=uranium-238] on Cerys.\n\nThe following facts about this process may be noted:\n\n• Chests with more [item=uranium-238] have a higher probability of mutating into [plutonium-239] compared to chests with a single [item=uranium-238]: the chance is per [item=uranium-238], not per exposure.\n\n• [item=uranium-238] sitting out on belts has a ~10X chance to be mutated compared to [item=uranium-238] sitting inside chests.\n\n• The plutonium mutation probability is unaffected by the speed of the [entity=cerys-solar-wind-particle].\n\n• Mutation of [item=uranium-238] in inventories such as chests can still occur even if there are no empty stack slots, as the solar wind will delete a stack of uranium if necessary.\n\n• [entity=cerys-solar-wind-particle] will not trigger the mutation chance when repeatedly colliding with the same inventory or belt, such as by hovering over it in a stationary position; collisions with other inventories or belts are required before the original inventory or belt is considered for mutation once again.\n\n• For performance reasons, [entity=cerys-solar-wind-particle] is simulated more slowly if no player is looking at Cerys, but the mutation chances are increased such that the rate of [item=plutonium-239] generation is unchanged.

cerys-prevent-cargo-drops-without-technology=Players are exempted.
cerys-disable-solar-wind-when-not-looking-at-surface=By default, the UPS usage of solar wind is drastically reduced if no player is looking at Cerys. This setting disables the movement of solar wind entirely in this case, fully optimizing for UPS. This has gameplay implications.
cerys-disable-flare-stack-item-venting=When GotLag's Flare Stack was ported to 2.0, its item venting entities were ported as incinerators. Since Space Age introduces the recycler, this setting is on by default.
cerys-technology-compatibility-mode=The Fulgoran cryogenics technology uses a 2.0 feature that is not supported by all recipe-sensitive mods. This setting changes the technology trigger such that instead of unlocking by completing recipes, the technology is unlocked by crafting items (the Ancient structure repair part).
cerys-solar-wind-spawn-rate-percentage=For performance optimization. Has an effect on gameplay.
cerys-disable-quality-mechanics=Compatibility setting. Removes recipes to upgrade the quality of Fulgoran machines.
cerys-enforce-vanilla-recycling-recipes=Ensures that certain recycling recipes keep their vanilla form so that Cerys is more likely to be playable. Affects: pipe, heat pipe, beacon, steam turbine, centrifuge, iron gear wheel, copper cable, electronic circuit, advanced circuit, processing unit, concrete, solid fuel, steel plate, copper plate, iron plate, stone brick, plastic bar, holmium plate. Note: Some overrides do not apply when Krastorio 2 is installed.

cerys-infinite-braking-technology=Necessary to take full advantage of plutonium fuel. Disabled by default as Cerys is a self-contained mod.
cerys-sandbox-mode=Removes the restriction on cargo drops on Cerys. This circumvents the intended gameplay of the moon but provides a shorter freestyle experience.
