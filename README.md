# Cerys

You discover Cerys, a moon of Fulgora whose ruins lie frozen under a thick layer of dry ice. As you touch down, methane ice crystals scatter into the vacuum. Asteroids wander overhead, along with a gentle solar wind under Fulgora’s magnetic influence.

Many frozen structures lie embedded in the surface. Though made of new materials, they bear the hallmarks of the Fulgorans. As you explore, it becomes apparent that without lightning, they turned to another source of power.

## Features

- Brand new gameplay:
    - Uncover ancient wrecks from multiple layers of ice.
    - Repair machine ruins by various methods.
    - Defrost your factory with a new mechanic, different to Aquilo.
    - Solve the workings of plutonium.
    - Unlike planets, the play area is finite. Terrain curves as you approach the moon's edge.
- Traditional mining is combined with a novel recycling chain based on nuclear components. Iron is a scarce resource, providing challenge in the early-game. Logistic bots appear only later in the gameplay.
- It is said that due to the solar wind, cargo pods cannot drop resources onto Cerys (without researching a specific technology.)
- It is simple to include Cerys in existing saves as there are zero changes to vanilla: no restrictions on vanilla planets, changes to vanilla gameplay, or new recipes with purely vanilla items.
- On first playthrough, Cerys is equal parts puzzle game and Space Age planet.

## Notes

- Cerys originally contained a revamp of [GotLag’s Flare Stack](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/GotLag/Flare%20Stack). We later assisted snouz to port the original mod to 2.0. In the current version, with Cerys installed, flare stacks are unlocked on Cerys and incinerators are disabled by default since Space Age brings the recycler (but this latter change can be reverted in the mod settings).
- We didn't set out to make a 'planet'. This mod grew out of roc experimenting with a recycling chain based on nuclear plant components after the release of [Hardcore Fulgora](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Rocs-Hardcore-Fulgora).
