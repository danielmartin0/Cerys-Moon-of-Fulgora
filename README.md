# Cerys

You discover Cerys, a moon of Fulgora whose ruins lie frozen under a thick layer of dry ice. As you touch down, methane ice crystals scatter into the vacuum. Asteroids wander overhead, along with a gentle solar wind under Fulgora’s magnetic influence.

Many frozen structures lie embedded in the surface. Though made of new materials, they bear the hallmarks of the Fulgorans. As you explore, it becomes apparent that without lightning, they turned to another source of power.

## Features

- Brand new gameplay:
    - Uncover ancient wrecks from multiple layers of ice and repair them by various methods.
    - Defrost your factory with a new mechanic, different to Aquilo.
    - The play area of the moon is finite. Terrain curves as you approach the moon's edge and the day-night boundary travels across the surface.
    - Solve the workings of plutonium and unlock devastating weaponry.
- Traditional mining is combined with a new scrap recycling chain based on nuclear components.
- It is said that due to the solar wind, cargo pods cannot drop resources onto Cerys without researching a specific technology. Construction bots are excepted.
- Designed for maximum compatibility with zero changes to the vanilla items, recipes or features.
- On first playthrough, Cerys is equal parts puzzle game and Space Age planet.

## Notes

- Cerys is more difficult than most vanilla planets. (For a trickier version still, install [Hardcore Cerys](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Rocs-Hardcore-Cerys).)
- Dynamic lighting on Cerys can be disabled in the settings if you find it distracting.
- If you would like to visit Cerys without being trapped, use the QoL mod [Planet Hopper](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Planet-Hopper).
- This mod originally contained a revamp of [GotLag’s Flare Stack](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/GotLag/Flare%20Stack). We later assisted snouz to port the original mod to 2.0. As a result, with Cerys installed, the flare stack technology is moved to the Cerys tech tree.

### Localization

- English, Chinese, French, Ukrainian, Korean, Russian, Japanese.
    - To help translate more languages, submit a pull request on Github (after playing the game to get context.) Please note that some locale lines are stored in the [PlanetsLib](https://github.com/danielmartin0/PlanetsLib) Github.
