Ancient wrecks lodged under thick ice can seemingly be repaired, including a colossal Fulgoran reactor that could transform the possibilities on the surface... if you can manage to get it working.\n\nCerys is a largely (not fully) complete and polished mod that does not affect the vanilla game, so is easy to include in existing saves.",
