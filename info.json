Ancient wrecks embedded in thick ice can seemingly be repaired, including a colossal nuclear reactor that could transform the possibilities on the surface... if you can get it working.\n\nCerys is a polished and complete planet mod that does not affect the vanilla game in any way, so is easy to include in existing saves.",
